        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a student in the Masters of Science in Geospatial Technologies program at 
          the University of Washington in Tacoma. I have over 8 years experience working
          in GIS, primarily in the electric utility industry. I also have a BS in Geology 
          from Western Washington University.
          
          I enjoy coding, working with data, and helping people solve problems. Outside 
          of my studies, I enjoy gaming (of all kinds: video, board, & table top RPG),
          bicycling, and camping.
